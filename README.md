# ‚òï Coffee Sales Analysis (Ecommerce SQL Project)

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **SQL queries** to analyze coffee sales data stored in an `ecommerce` database.
It covers **data cleaning, transformation, revenue analysis, profit calculation, joins, subqueries, and views** to extract business insights.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database & Tables

* **Database:** `ecommerce`
* **Tables Used:**

  * `mytable` ‚Üí contains sales transactions (`date`, `coffee_name`, `price`, `card`)
  * `mytable1` ‚Üí additional data (for practice queries)
  * `make_cost` ‚Üí contains cost price for each coffee

---

## üîë Key SQL Queries

### 1. Get All Data from Tables

```sql
SELECT * FROM mytable;
SELECT * FROM mytable1;
```

### 2. Data Cleaning: Replace NULL with "cash"

```sql
UPDATE mytable
SET card = 'cash'
WHERE card IS NULL;
```

### 3. Retrieve Date & Coffee Name

```sql
SELECT date, coffee_name FROM mytable;
```

### 4. Rename Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE mytable
RENAME COLUMN money TO price;
```

### 5. Revenue by Coffee

```sql
SELECT coffee_name, SUM(price) AS revenue
FROM mytable
GROUP BY coffee_name;
```

### 6. Unique Coffee Types with Prices

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT coffee_name, price FROM mytable;
```

### 7. Average Sales per Day

```sql
SELECT date, AVG(price) AS avg_revenue
FROM mytable
GROUP BY date;
```

### 8. Highest Revenue Day

```sql
SELECT date, SUM(price) AS highest_revenue
FROM mytable
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY highest_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 9. Top 5 Best-Selling Coffees

```sql
SELECT coffee_name, COUNT(coffee_name) AS top_5_coffee
FROM mytable
GROUP BY coffee_name
ORDER BY top_5_coffee DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 10. Join Sales with Cost Table

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mytable mt
JOIN make_cost mc
ON mt.coffee_name = mc.coffee_name;
```

### 11. Profit by Coffee

```sql
SELECT mt.coffee_name,
       SUM(mt.price - mc.coffee_cost) AS profit
FROM mytable mt
JOIN make_cost mc 
     ON mt.coffee_name = mc.coffee_name
GROUP BY mt.coffee_name
ORDER BY profit DESC;
```

### 12. Create and Use a View (Daily Revenue)

```sql
CREATE VIEW daily_revenue AS
SELECT date, SUM(price) AS revenue
FROM mytable
GROUP BY date;

SELECT * FROM daily_revenue ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

---

## üìä Insights Gained

* Identified **top-selling coffee types**.
* Found the **highest revenue-generating day**.
* Calculated **profit margins** by comparing price vs. cost.
* Cleaned sales data by handling **NULL values**.
* Created a **daily revenue view** for easier analysis.
